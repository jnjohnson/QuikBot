# QuikBot

A bot designed to automatically purchase an NES Classic from an online retailer.

This idea came about because my sister was trying to buy an NES Classic for her boyfriend, but when Wal-Mart got new stock in their online store, it instantly ran out.

## Start up

To get the project set up:
`npm init`

To start up the server:
`node index.js`
