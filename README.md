# QuikBot
A bot designed to automatically purchase a Nintendo Switch from an online retailer (Retialer to be determined later).

This idea came about because my sister was trying to buy a Switch for her boyfriend, but when Wal-Mart got new stock in their online store, it instantly ran out.
I may later expand this project to include other such items from a multitude of retailers.
